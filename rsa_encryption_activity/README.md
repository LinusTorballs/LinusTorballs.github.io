## What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Symmetric encryption uses a single key that is shared between computers to encrypt and decrypt files. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, one private and one public.

## Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

The first step of encryption is sharing the public key of one user. The second step of encryption is the sender using the public key to encrypt the text. The third step of encryption is the encrypted text being sent. The fourth step of encryption and decryption is the receiver of the message using their private key to turn the encrypted text into plaintext.

## Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

Sharing your secret key would result in others being able to decrypt the mssages that were intended to be only for you.
